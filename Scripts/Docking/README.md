## Dockin Station or Laptop Screen

I use docking station with Openbox on my laptop.
My aim is to use the least amount of resources possible.

I do not want to create a service that will check whenever a dockin station is connected and change the screen settings

Instead I have created 2 scripts.
In each script I have different xrandr sttings.
